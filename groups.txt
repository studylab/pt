The first raw list of possible groups was:

    . Laptop order entry point group (see the Money section below)
    . keyboard group
    . screen group
    . motherboard group
    . cpu group
    . RAM group
    . harddrive and storage group
    . casing group
    . power supply group
    . battery group
    . trackpad group
    . connectivity (usb, dvi, thunderbird, etc...) group
    . wifi group
    . ethernet group 
    . speaker and sound group
    . assembly group
    . storage and distribution group


Now, we rearrange that raw list into logical blocks that makes more
sense as a starting structure. It is just the begining and of course
there are only a few people involved who can only handle so much groups.
The granularity will increase with the number of people involved.


So we have now 5 super groups:


I   Logistic Group:
    . Laptop order entry point group (see the Money section below)
    . assembly group
    . stocks and distribution group

II  Computing Group:
    . motherboard group
    . cpu group
    . RAM group
    . harddrive and storage group

III IO Group:
    . screen group
    . connectivity (usb, dvi, thunderbird, etc...) group
    . wifi group
    . ethernet group 

IV  UX Group:
    . keyboard group
    . trackpad group
    . speaker and sound group
    . casing group

V   Energy Group:
    . power supply group
    . battery group


------------------------------------------------------


I   Logistic Group:
===================
    . Laptop order entry point group
    . assembly group
    . stocks and distribution group


Entry point:

    price targets:
      version 1 proof of concept: max USD$500
      version 2 real machine: max USD$1000

    contact: email us.
    order: send
            address for delivery
            quantity  
            payment


Assembly:

There will probably be no assembly for the proof of concept, or even
maybe for all the future verions since it is supposed to be a freely
upgradable machine, therefore with all components accessible to the
user.


Distribution:

The distribution will send all the elements to the address given by the
buyer. Should it be sent in one big package or in multiple packages shipped
directly by the supplier to keep the logistic to a minimum for now (for ever ?).



II   Computing Group:
=====================
    . motherboard group
    . cpu group
    . RAM group
    . harddrive and storage group
    . graphic card

Which hardware is the most GNU/Linux friendly ?
AMD or Intel ?

  version 1 proof of concept:
    mother board:
    cpu:
    RAM:   16G minimum
    hdd:  256G minimum
    graphic card:

  version 2: to be determined.




III  IO Group:
==============
    . screen group
    . connectivity (usb, dvi, thunderbird, etc...) group
    . wifi group
    . ethernet group 


Screen group:

Mate screen, and high definition 2560-by-1600 (close to current macbook pro spec)

wifi:
No Linux difficulty non sense with drivers.

IV  UX Group:
=============
    . keyboard group
    . trackpad group
    . speaker and sound group
    . casing group

Keyboard:
The ideals are the Apple IIc keyboard from the 80's, or the nice
IBM Thinkpads keyboard, the one before Lenovo changed it following
the current Apple keyboard idea of spaced out keys.
Also, it should preferably be water proof.


V   Energy Group:
=================
    . power supply group
    . battery group

Figure out precisely what is the power consumption of the machine.
Use the most standards plug shape.
Figure out a stand alone solution with a solar panel.
The battery aspect will be key with a solar panel solution.
