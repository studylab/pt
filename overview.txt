  Open Source Organisation for a great latop
==============================================

 I- Open Source/Freedom organization to assemble the perfect laptop

    This is not an open source software, not an open source hardware, no,
    this is an open source organization.

    Let's build the first version of this open source organization,
    that will assemble a pleasant laptop computer tool for computer professionals.

    We are not going to chase the latest fad in computing look and design,
    we are simply here to assemble a robust, reliable, dependable, easily upgradable
    laptop computer. Regarding the appearance of the result, we are simply counting
    on the fact that form follows function.

    The computer industry has been too slow to deliver such an appliance, so
    we are taking things in our own hands.

    Since assembling a computer is all about information really,
    and the fact that our computer tools and the Internet are built
    for just that, manipulating information, we should be able to create
    an open source organisation thanks to these tools. That organisation
    would assemble the Perfect Laptop!
    It would be first and foremost aimed at computer professionals: programmers,
    engineers, video editing, music creators...
    Maybe eventually the general public may come to it.
    
    We need collaborating groups:
    What could be these groups ?
    . Laptop order entry point group
    . keyboard group
    . screen group
    . motherboard group
    . casing group
    . power supply group
    . trackpad group
    . connectivity (usb, dvi, thunderbird, etc...) group
    . wifi group
    . ethernet group 
    . speaker and sound group
    . harddrive and storage group
    . RAM group
    . cpu group
    . assembly group
    . storage and distribution group

    Now we would need people to participate in any (one or more) of these groups.
    
    Maybe one group that comes early is the motherboard group.
    What are the possible motherboards being available today in April 2016 ?
    What are the dimensions and the shape to fit in a case that the casing group
    will try to find or make it produced if we have precisely defined specs and
    enough orders are placed.
    
    This whole open source organization concept has to be invented, it is all new,
    so for the moment everything is wide open for our imagination...
    
    How will these groups communicate smoothly with each other ? They will operate with
    software tools that also need to be created open source style.
    
    Each group could have a code that would interact with all the other group
    through APIs. For this ambitious idea, we have to forget the phone, pen
    and papers as a way to organize the whole thing... only software and APIs.
