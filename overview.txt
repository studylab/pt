==============================================
  Free Organization for a great laptop
==============================================

This is an off the wall project idea, but let's just have our imagination
run wilde and free for now.

I am starting to think that we should pay more attention to the terminology
the FSF (www.fsf.org) is using regarding the important difference between
open source and free (as freedom).
Should our new type of organization we are building here be viewed as open source
or free ?
Since the free software philosophy is a very intersting and seemingly user enpowering
proposition, I would intuitively suspect there is an appeal for a free organization.
Maybe a free organization is also the best fit to create free software and also,
very importantly here, free hardware.
So instead of talking about an open source organization, let's call it now
a free organization.



With that in mind here is a newer version of this overview text:



 I- Free (as in freedom) organization to assemble a great laptop

    This is not an open source/free software, not an open source/free hardware, no,
    this is a free *organization*.

    Let's build the first version of this free organization,
    that will assemble a pleasant laptop computer tool for computer professionals.

    We are not going to chase the latest fad in computer hardware look and design, with
    the latest bells and whistles, and other non-sense distractions to steer the average
    user into a given product. We are simply here to assemble a robust, reliable, dependable,
    easily upgradable laptop computer. Regarding the appearance of the result, we are counting
    on the fact that form follows function.

    The computer industry has been too slow to deliver such an appliance (and I am not
    even talking about the somehow disappointing new macbook pro 2016...), so
    we are taking things in our own hands.

    Assembling a computer is all about information after all. As is the manufacturing of
    all things really.
    Our personal computers and the Internet are tools built for just that, i.e handling
    information. Therefore we should be able to create this free organization with these tools,
    that would assemble a great laptop!
    It would be first and foremost aimed at computer professionals: programmers,
    engineers, video editing, music creators...

    My guess is we are going to start with one basic model, upgradable indefinitely.
    Later we will probably looking at an additional model with a larger screen,
    once we already have succeeded in the creation of the first model.
    
    The vision is to organize ourselves into collaborating groups. A groups
    for each element and sub-element of the product beeing built, here a laptop:
    What could be these groups ?
    . Laptop order entry point group (see the Money section below)
    . keyboard group
    . screen group
    . motherboard group
    . cpu group
    . RAM group
    . harddrive and storage group
    . casing group
    . power supply group
    . battery group
    . trackpad group
    . connectivity (usb, dvi, thunderbird, etc...) group
    . wifi group
    . ethernet group 
    . speaker and sound group
    . assembly group
    . storage and distribution group

    These groups simply consist of people distributed around the world working together
    as one unit via the Internet, through APIs.

    People can freely participate in any (one or more) of these groups, which ever
    is more interesting to them, very much like how open source/free software works nowadays.

    Maybe one group that should come early is the motherboard group.
    What are the possible motherboards being available today in April 2016 ?
    What are the dimensions and the shape to fit in a case that the casing group
    will find or produce with precisely defined specs.
    
    This whole open source organization concept is being invented, it is all new,
    so for the moment everything is wide open for our imagination...
    
    How will these groups communicate smoothly with each other ? They will operate with
    software tools that also need to be created free software style.
    
    Each group could have a code that would interact with all the other group
    through APIs. For this ambitious idea, we have to forget the phone, pen
    and papers as a way to organize the whole thing... only software and APIs.

    
II- Money

    Hardware manufacturing and shipping will require financing. We are not dealing
    with just software here, which costs nothing to move around. Hardware has hard
    physical realities attributes.

    The solution envisioned is: as the knowledge, software and hardware crop up,
    the money, the financing for the hardware manufacturing + shipping will
    trickle down the group tree.

    We probably should find a way to compensate financially all the different groups,
    beyond just the hardware manufacturing and shipping, but also for the time and energies
    provided by all these groups. It will be probably tricky to get it right, but like
    everything else, things will be optimized along the way.

    The "Laptop order entry point group" will be there as a meeting point between
    the laptop buyers and the whole ecosystem of groups. At this entry point will
    come in the orders ( specs, quantity, payment, delivery address) and come out
    the laptops.
