  Open source hardware laptop organisation

 I- Open Source/Freedom organization to assemble the perfect laptop

    This is not an open source software, not an open source hardware,
    no this is an open source organization.

    Let's build the first version, v0.1 of this open source organization,
    that will assemble a pleasant laptop computer tool for computer professionals.

    Let's breathe a little be here. We are not going to chase the latest
    fad in computing look and design, we are simply here to assemble a robust,
    reliable, dependable, easily upgradable laptop computer. Regarding the appearance
    of the result, we are simply counting on the fact that form follows function.

    The computer industry has been too slow to deliver such an appliance, so
    we are taking things in our own hands.

    Since assembling a machine (computer) is all about information
    and computer tools and the Internet are built for manipulating
    information, then we should be able to create an open source
    organisation. That organisation would assemble the Perfect Laptop!
    At least for computer experts: programmers, video editing, music creators...
    Then eventually the general public may come to it.
    
    We need collaborating groups:
    What could be these groups ?
    . Laptop order entry point group
    . keyboard group
    . screen group
    . motherboard group
    . casing group
    . power supply group
    . trackpad group
    . connectivity (usb, dvi, thunderbird, etc...) group
    . wifi group
    . ethernet group 
    . speaker and sound group
    . harddrive and storage group
    . RAM group
    . cpu group
    . assembly group
    . storage and distribution group

    Now we would need people to participate in one or more or these groups.
    
    Maybe one group that comes early is the motherboard group.
    What are the possible motherboards being available today in January 2016 ?
    What are the dimensions and the shape to fit in a case that the casing group
    will try to find or make it produced if we have precisely defined specs and
    enough orders are placed.
    
    This whole open source organization concept has to be invented, it is all new,
    so for the moment everything is wide open for our imagination...
    
    How will these groups communicate smoothly with each other ? I am thinking with
    software tools that also probably need to be created of course open source style.
    
    Each group could have a code that would interact with all the other group
    through APIs. For this ambitious idea, we may have to forget the phone pen
    and papers as a way to organize the whole thing...
